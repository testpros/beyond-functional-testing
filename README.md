# Go Beyond Functional Testing

Selenium is built for exercising browsers in a similar manner to that of an end user, 
and it's great for functional testing. As many of us have realized, Selenium is not 
great at non-functional testing, whether that be layout, usability, performance, or 
other types of testing. But that doesn't mean that your tests themselves can't be 
repurposed to assist in these areas. Join Max in a hands on workshop to learn some 
techniques on how to expand the testing your Selenium scripts can accomplish.

Max will cover 3 techniques: how to get security results by running Selenium tests, 
how to retrieve accessibility results from pages you test, and how to transform 
your Selenium tests into performance tests. Come with a laptop as we will walk 
through examples, and leave with a better understanding how to expand your testing 
coverage, with minimal additional effort.
